1. 
   - We should avoid getting lost in our own thoughts when someone is telling us something.
   - We shouldn't interrupt someone while he/she is speaking. First let them finish.
   -  Use phrases which show that you are also taking interest in the conversation. This helps in keeping conversation lively.
   - You can also use your body language to show someone that you are interested in what he/she is telling you.
   - If appropriate, make notes while listening.
   - Maintaining eye contact is also crucial while conversing with someone.
   

2. 
  - It increases understanding between the two as now listener knows the speaker better than earlier after listening him\her.
  - It can help the speaker to clarify his/her thoughts.
  - It can reassure the speaker that someone is willing to attend to his or her point of view and wants to help.


3. My problem is that when someone is telling me something, sometimes they use a specific word of which I don't the meaning but as they are continuing forward, I don't want to break their momentum so instead of stopping them I let them move on with the conversation without understanding the real meaning behind their word.


4. I think I should tell them right away if I don't get a single thing in their conversation as I think it is better to stop them instead of letting them speak without even getting a single word.


5. I personally use passive style when my friend calls me to share some thoughts and need some support or guidance.


6. To make your work done sometimes you have to be aggressive. As I am currently living in pg, so here it's a rule like daily cleaning has to be done but nothing like that is followed. So, talking to them aggressively only makes the work done otherwise they just ignore.


7. I only talk with this way with a friend or atleast someone I know as it requires understanding as if I am joking about something with someone I don't know, he may find it aggressive. 


8. I think the biggest change I need is to prioritize my needs first from anyone else as I also don't give attention to what I want. I will try to be moree honest about my feelings from now onwards.
