   - Firstly, break the thing you want to learn in parts. Like, to learn a thing, you need to know few other smaller things. So, do that and start with most important smaller parts so that your performance will improve fastly.
   -  You should learn enough so that if you make a mistake, you should know how to handle that. 
   - You should remove all the practice barriers around you when you are devoting your time to learn something seriously.
   - The last one is that to learn about something, you atleast have to devote your 20 hours to that.

   - Firstly, I loved the idea of active and diffused minds and giving example of one of the great scientists, Thomas Alva Edison, was very great from my perspective as I am an Engineer too.
   - Secondly, I would like to apply the 20 hour rule moving forward to learn a topic.
